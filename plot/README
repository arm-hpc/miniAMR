--------------------------------------
1. overview

     This plot package allows 2D or 3D plotting of the block structure of
miniAMR.  The package is dependent on Sandia's SEACAS package, but could
be adapted for other plotting packages.  Information about the block
structure of a simulation are read in from the plot output from miniAMR,
the data is sorted according to input to the plotting program, and then
written out.

-------------------
3. Building plot:

     To make the code, type 'make' in the directory containing the source.
The enclosed Makefile is configured for a general installation with SEACAS
libraries.  Other compiler or other machines will need changes in the CFLAGS
variable to correspond with the flags available for the compiler being used.

-------------------
4. Running plot:

 The plotting package can be run like this:

   %  ./plot.x <options>

 Execution is then driven by the options present, some of which are required.
To see options available type:

    % ./plot.x --help

     To run the program, there are several arguments on the command line.
The list of arguments and their defaults is as follows:

   -i <filename>
      The input filename which is required.

   -o <filename>
      The output filename (default is plot.gen).

   -x <plane>
   -y <plane>
   -z <plane>
      This creates a cutting plane through the mesh, where the argument plane
      is between 0 and 1 inclusive.  This will result in a 2D plot of the
      blocks intersected by the cutting plane.  The blocks are grouped by
      their level of refinement.

   -3
      This causes all blocks to be output in 3D, with the blocks grouped
      by the processor number that they are on.
      balance at each refinement step.

 One of -x, -y, -z, or -3 is required for plotting.

-------------------
5. The code:

   plot.c    Controls the plotting step
   read.c    Read information from miniAMR plot file
   sort.c    Sort information for plotting
   write.c   Write out sorted information in EXODUS format
